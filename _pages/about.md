I'm a project coordinator in the German Human Phenome-Genome Archive ([GHGA](https://www.ghga.de)) at the German Cancer Research Center ([DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html)) in Germany working on the European Genomic Data Infrastructure ([GDI](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu)). I'm currently on leave as a researcher at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing ([LNCC](https://www.lncc.br)) in Brazil. I received my D.Sc. degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/en/)), Brazil. I've been involved in the research and development of parallel and distributed scientific workflow management systems and scientific databases. I've participated in research projects in the bioinformatics and biodiversity application areas. My main research interests are scientific workflows, research data management, and parallel computing. I'm a member of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
