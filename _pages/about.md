I'm an IT Engineer for Research Data Management at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de), working in the [Cluster of Excellence GreenRobust](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/research-profile/fields-of-focus/field-of-focus-ii-health-biology-and-earth-system-dynamics/greenrobust). I received my D.Sc. degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/en/) (UFRJ), Brazil, with a doctoral internship at the [Computation Institute](https://voices.uchicago.edu/compinst/) at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory in the United States.

Previously, I was a Research Associate at [Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de) working on the Cluster of Excellence Balance of the Microverse, a Project Coordinator at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de) for the European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) and the [German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA)](https://www.ghga.de), and a Technologist at the [National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC)](https://www.lncc.br) in Brazil.

My main research interests are scientific data engineering, computational workflows, research data management, and FAIR principles. I've been involved in the research and development of parallel and distributed scientific workflow management systems and scientific databases, particularly in the bioinformatics and biodiversity application areas.
