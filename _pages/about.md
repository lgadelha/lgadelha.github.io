I'm an IT and Reseearch Data Engineer at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de), working in the [Cluster of Excellence GreenRobust](https://greenrobust.de). I received my D.Sc. degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/en/) (UFRJ), Brazil, with a doctoral internship at the [Computation Institute](https://voices.uchicago.edu/compinst/) at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory in the United States.

Previously, I was a Project Coordinator at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de) for the [European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/) and the [German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA)](https://www.ghga.de), a Research Associate at [Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de) working on the [Cluster of Excellence Balance of the Microverse](https://www.microverse-cluster.de/en/), and a Technologist at the [National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC)](https://www.lncc.br) in Brazil.

My main topics of interests are scientific data engineering, computational workflows, research data management, and the FAIR principles. I've been also involved in the research and development of parallel and distributed scientific workflow management systems and scientific databases, particularly in the bioinformatics and biodiversity application areas.
